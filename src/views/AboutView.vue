        Hello, <br />
        <br />
        name is Duy Khoi Nguyen &amp; I'm a Software Engineer who graduated 2023
        with a Bachelor degree in Computer Science at Flensburg University of
        Applied Sciences. <br />
        This Project is a playground where I try out things with vue.js. Since
        Vue.js is one of the most popular Frameworks for Webdevelopment it
        should be abit familiar with it. When I want to get more into
        Webdevelopment.
